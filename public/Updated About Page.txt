            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center text-gray-800 mb-6">Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
                To bridge the gap between NDIS participants and the right living environments—where care, comfort, and community come together. We understand that finding the right accommodation isn’t just about a room, it’s about compatibility, dignity, support, and most importantly, independence. That’s why we’ve created a platform that makes it easy for participants, families, support coordinators, and providers to connect meaningfully.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">Why We Started</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Navigating the NDIS system can be overwhelming—especially when it comes to finding the right SIL or SDA property that matches both your needs and preferences. We started [Your Business Name] after seeing too many participants struggle to find a home that felt like theirs.
                From mismatched accommodations to long waitlists and a lack of transparency, we knew there had to be a better way.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">So we created a platform that:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
                <li>Highlights verified and curated NDIS friendly accommodations</li>
                <li>Allows participants to match based on their personal preferences</li>
                <li>Gives providers a streamlined way to manage and fill their vacancies</li>
                <li>Supports families and coordinators in making informed housing decisions</li>
            </ul>
